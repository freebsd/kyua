# Welcome to the Kyua project!

Kyua is a **testing framework** for operating systems.

Kyua features an **expressive test suite definition language**, a **safe
runtime engine** for test suites and a **powerful report generation
engine**.

Kyua is for **both developers *and* users**, from the developer applying a
simple fix to a library to the system administrator deploying a new release
on a production machine.

Kyua is **able to execute test programs written with a plethora of testing
libraries and languages**.  The library of choice is
[ATF](https://github.com/jmmv/atf/), for which Kyua was originally
designed, but simple, framework-less test programs and TAP-compliant test
programs can also be executed through Kyua.

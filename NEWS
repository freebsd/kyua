Changes in version 0.3
======================

STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT; NOT RELEASED YET.

* Switched to use Lutok instead of our own wrappers over the Lua C
  library.  Lutok is just what used to be our own utils::lua module,
  but is now distributed separately.

* Renamed the user-specific configuration file from ~/.kyuarc to
  ~/.kyua/kyua.conf for consistency with other files stored in the
  ~/.kyua/ subdirectory.

* Added the db-exec command to directly interact with the store
  database.

* Made the 'test' command generate persistent output (SO FAR WE ONLY
  STORE THE ACTION DATA; REWORD THIS ONCE WE ADD TEST RESULTS SUPPORT).
  As a side effect, 'test' now supports a '--store' option to indicate
  where the database lives.

* Added the 'report' command to generate plain-text reports of the
  test results stored in the database.

* Removed the 'Atffile's from the source tree.  Kyua is stable enough
  to generate trustworthy reports, and we do not want to give the
  impression that atf-run / atf-report are still supported.

* Issue 28: Added support for the 'require.memory' test case property
  introduced in ATF 0.15.


Changes in version 0.2
======================

Experimental version released on August 24th, 2011.

The biggest change in this release is the ability for Kyua to run test
programs implemented using different frameworks.  What this means is
that, now, a Kyua test suite can include not only ATF-based test
programs, but also "legacy" (aka plain) test programs that do not use
any framework.  I.e. if you have tests that are simple programs that
exit with 0 on success and 1 on failure, you can plug them in into a
Kyua test suite.

Other than this, there have been several user-visible changes.  The most
important are the addition of the new 'config' and 'debug' subcommands
to the 'kyua' binary.  The former can be used to inspect the runtime
configuration of Kyua after parsing, and the latter is useful to
interact with failing tests cases in order to get more data about the
failure itself.

Without further ado, here comes the itemized list of changes:

* Generalized the run-time engine to support executing test programs
  that implement different interfaces.  Test programs that use the ATF
  libraries are just a special case of this.  (Issue 18.)

* Added support to the engine to run "plain" test programs: i.e. test
  programs that do not use any framework and report their pass/fail
  status as an exit code.  This is to simplify the integration of legacy
  test programs into a test suite, and also to demonstrate that the
  run-time engine is generic enough to support different test
  interfaces.  (Issue 18.)

* Added the 'debug' subcommand.  This command allows end users to tweak
  the execution of a specific test case and to poke into the behavior of
  its execution.  At the moment, all this command allows is to view the
  stdout and stderr of the command in real time (which the 'test'
  command currently completely hides).

* Added the 'config' subcommand.  This command allows the end user to
  inspect the current configuration variables after evaluation, without
  having to read through configuration files.  (Issue 11.)

* Removed the test_suites_var function from configuration files.  This
  was used to set the value of test-suite-sepecific variables, but it
  was ugly-looking.  It is now possible to use the more natural syntax
  'test_suites.<test-suite-name>.<variable> = <value>'.  (Issue 11.)

* Added a mechanism to disable the loading of configuration files
  altogether.  Needed for testing purposes and for scriptability.
  Available by passing the '--config=none' flag.

* Enabled detection of unused parameters and variables in the code and
  fixed all warnings.  (Issue 23.)

* Changed the behavior of "developer mode".  Compiler warnings are now
  enabled unconditionally regardless of whether we are in developer mode
  or not; developer mode is now only used to perform strict warning
  checks and to enable assertions.  Additionally, developer mode is now
  only automatically enabled when building from the repository, not for
  formal releases.  (Issue 22.)

* Fixed many build and portability problems to Debian sid with GCC 4.6.3
  and Ubuntu 10.04.1 LTS.  (Issues 20, 21, 26.)


Changes in version 0.1
======================

Experimental version released on June 23rd, 2011.

This is the first public release of the kyua-cli package.

The scope of this release is to provide functional replacement for the
'atf-run' utility included in the atf package.  At this point, 'kyua'
can reliably run the NetBSD 5.99.53 test suite delivering the same
results as 'atf-run'.

The reporting facilities of this release are quite limited.  There is
no replacement for 'atf-report' yet, and there is no easy way of
debugging failing test programs other than running them by hand.  These
features will mark future milestones and therefore be part of other
releases.

Be aware that this release has suffered very limited field testing.
The test suite for kyua-cli is quite comprehensive, but some bugs may
be left in any place.

Changes in version 0.2
======================

STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT; NOT RELEASED YET.

* Fixed two problems regarding configuration parsing in atf-run: one
  to properly handle tab characters and one that caused an error with
  NetBSD's /bin/sh.


Changes in version 0.1
======================

Experimental version released on July 10th, 2012.

This is the first public release of the kyua-atf-compat package.

This first release is paired with the 0.16 release of ATF, which
disables the build of atf-run and atf-report by default.  The goal
of this package is, then, to provide compatibility utilities for
these disabled tools but using Kyua as the backend for the execution
of the tests.

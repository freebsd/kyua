.Nd Test suite description files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fn atf_test_program "string name" "[string test_suite]" "[string metadata]"
.Fn include "string path"
.Fn plain_test_program "string name" "[string test_suite]" "[string metadata]"
.Fn syntax "int version"
.Fn tap_test_program "string name" "[string test_suite]" "[string metadata]"
.Fn test_suite "string name"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A test suite is a collection of test programs and is represented by a
hierarchical layout of test binaries on the file system.  Any subtree of
the file system can represent a test suite, provided that it includes one
or more
.Nm Ns s ,
which are the test suite definition files.
.Pp
A
.Nm
is a Lua script whose purpose is to describe the structure of the test
suite it belongs to.  To do so, the script has access to a collection of
special functions provided by
.Xr kyua 1 .
.Pp
A typical
.Nm
will look similar to this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
syntax(2)

test_suite('first')

-- Declare the test programs that are in this directory.
atf_test_program{name='foo_test'}
atf_test_program{name='bar_test', test_suite='second'}
plain_test_program{name='legacy_test'}
plain_test_program{name='legacy2_test', allowed_architectures='amd64 i386',
                   required_files='/bin/ls', timeout=30}

-- Recurse into any subdirectories that may have other tests.
include('dir1/Kyuafile')
include('dir2/Kyuafile')

.Ss File versioning
Every
.Nm
file starts with a call to
.Fn syntax "int version" .
This call determines the specific schema used by the file so that future
backwards-incompatible modifications to the file can be introduced.
.Pp
Any new
.Nm
file should set
.Fa version
to
.Sq 2 .
.Ss Test suite definition
Every
.Nm
should define the name of the test suite it belongs to by calling the
.Fn test_suite
function at the very beginning.
Individual test programs can override this value in their definition, but
the most common style is to list a single test suite name for the whole
file.
.Pp
The purpose of the test suite name definition is to tell
.Xr kyua 1
scoping for the run-time configuration variables that these programs
accept.
.Ss Test program registration
A
.Nm
can register test programs by means of a variety of
.Fn *_test_program
functions, all of which take the name of a test program and a set of
optional metadata properties that describe such test program.
.Pp
The test programs to be registered must live in the current directory; in
other words, the various
.Fn *_test_program
calls cannot reference test programs in other directories.
The rationale for this is to force all
.Nm
files to be self-contained, and to simplify their internal representation.
.Pp
.Em ATF test programs
are those that use the
.Xr atf 7
libraries.  They can be registered with the
.Fn atf_test_program
table constructor.  This function takes the
.Fa name
of the test program, an optional
.Fa test_suite
name that overrides the global test suite name, and a collection of optional
metadata settings for all the test cases in the test program.  Any metadata
properties defined by the test cases themselves override the metadata values
defined here.
.Pp
.Em Plain test programs
are those that return 0 on success and non-0 on failure; in general, most test
programs (even those that use fancy unit-testing libraries) behave this way and
thus also qualify as plain test programs.
They can be registered with the
.Fn plain_test_program
table constructor.  This function takes the
.Fa name
of the test program, an optional
.Fa test_suite
name that overrides the global test suite name, and a collection of optional
metadata settings for the test program.
.Pp
.Em TAP test programs
are those that implement the Test Anything Protocol.
They can be registered with the
.Fn tap_test_program
table constructor.  This function takes the
.Fa name
of the test program, an optional
.Fa test_suite
name that overrides the global test suite name, and a collection of optional
metadata settings for the test program.
.Pp
The following metadata properties can be passed to any test program definition:
.Bl -tag -width allowedXarchitecturesXX -offset indent
.It Va allowed_architectures
Whitespace-separated list of machine architecture names allowed by the
test.  If empty or not defined, the test is allowed to run on any machine
architecture.
.It Va allowed_platforms
Whitespace-separated list of machine platform names allowed by the test.
If empty or not defined, the test is allowed to run on any machine
platform.
.It Va description
Textual description of the test.
.It Va required_configs
Whitespace-separated list of configuration variables that the test requires
to be defined before it can run.
.It Va required_disk_space
Amount of available disk space that the test needs to run successfully.
.It Va required_files
Whitespace-separated list of paths that the test requires to exist before
it can run.
.It Va required_memory
Amount of physical memory that the test needs to run successfully.
.It Va required_programs
Whitespace-separated list of basenames or absolute paths pointing to executable
binaries that the test requires to exist before it can run.
.It Va required_user
If empty, the test has no restrictions on the calling user for it to run.
If set to
.Sq unprivileged ,
the test needs to not run as root.
If set to
.Sq root ,
the test must run as root.
.It Va timeout
Amount of seconds that the test is allowed to execute before being killed.
.It Va X-NAME
Custom variable defined by the test, where
.Sq NAME
denotes the name of the variable.
.El
.Ss Recursion
To reference test programs in another subdirectory, a different
.Nm
must be created in that directory and it must be included into the original
.Nm
by means of the
.Fn include
function.
.Pp
Note that each file is processed in its own Lua environment: there is no
mechanism to pass state from one file to the other.  The reason for this is
that there is no such thing as a
.Dq top-level
.Nm
in a test suite: the user has to be able to run the test suite from any
directory in a given hierarchy, and this execution must not depend on files
that live in parent directories.
.Ss Top-level Kyuafile
Every system has a top directory into which test suites get installed.  The
default is
.Pa __TESTSDIR__ .
Within this directory live test suites, each of which is in an independent
subdirectory.  Each subdirectory can be provided separately by independent
third-party packages.
.Pp
Kyua allows running all the installed test suites at once in order to
provide comprehensive cross-component reports.  In order to do this, there
is a special file in the top directory that knows how to inspect the
subdirectories in search for other Kyuafiles and include them.
.Pp
The
.Sx FILES
section includes more details on where this file lives.

.Sh NAME
.Nm report-junit
.Nd Generates a JUnit report with the results of a test action
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl -action Ar id
.Op Fl -output Ar path
.Op Fl -store Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command provides a simple mechanism to generate JUnit reports of the
execution of a test suite.  The command processes an action stored in the
database and then generates a single XML file that complies to the JUnit
XSchema.
.Pp
The JUnit output is static and self-contained, so it can easily be plugged
into any continuous integration system, like Jenkins.
.Pp
The following subcommand options are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Fl -action Ar id
Specifies the action for which to generate a report.  If not provided,
defaults to the latest action stored in the database.
.It Fl -output Ar directory
Specifies the file into which to store the JUnit report.
.It Fl -store Ar path , Fl s Ar path
Specifies the database to use.  Defaults to
.Pa ~/.kyua/store.db .
.El
.Ss Caveats
Because of limitations in the JUnit XML schema, not all the data collected by
Kyua can be properly represented in JUnit reports.  However, because test data
are extremely useful for debugging purposes, the
.Nm
command shovels these data into the JUnit output.  In particular:
.Bl -bullet
.It
The test case metadata values are prepended to the test case's standard error
output.
.It
Test cases that report expected failures as their results are recorded as
passed.  The fact that they failed as expected is recorded in the test case's
standard error output along with the corresponding reason.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
command always returns 0.
.Pp
Additional exit codes may be returned as described in
.Xr kyua 1 .
